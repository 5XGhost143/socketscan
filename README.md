# WARNING

**NOTE: If youre using Windows, you have the option to use my installer. It may trigger a false positive because the shortcuts are created using WScripts. You can review the source code here: https://github.com/5XGhost143/5XInstaller. Also, since the installer is built with PyInstaller, you can decompile it to verify its contents.**
